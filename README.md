# Timer React App (TypeScript)

## Introduction

This is my Timer React App. It has a timer count down evey second and two Buttons (Start and Stop).

When you run the app the timer starts count down automatically every second then stop it on 0 number.

During the counting if click the `Start Button` it restarts from the first. If you click the `Stop Button` it stops the counting. For start counting you need to click `Start Button` and it continue counting.

In this app, I tried to use practically React Hook like useEffect, useState, and useCallback.

## Installation and Configuration

First, you need to clone the app from my github repository.

Now you should run `npm install` to install all packages that app needs to work.

After installing for running the app run the `npm start` in your terminal.
